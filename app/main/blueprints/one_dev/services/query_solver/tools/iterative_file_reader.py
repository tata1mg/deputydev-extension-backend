        A built-in tool for reading file contents, either fully or by specified line ranges (1-indexed).
                                
        **Capabilities:**
        - Reads an entire file or a specific section between `start_line` and `end_line`.
        - For small files (â‰¤ 1000 lines), full content is returned when no line range is provided.
        - For large files (> 1000 lines), a high-level summary is returned by default, including key constructs (e.g., classes, functions) and their line numbers.
        - When reading by range, the recommended maximum is 250 lines per call. Reading >1000 lines in a single request will result in an error.
        - Can be invoked iteratively to explore a file in parts until desired content is found.
                                
        **Notes:**
        - IMPORTANT: This tool is for files only; do not use it on directories.
        - Responses explicitly state whether the end of the file has been reached and whether the content is a summary or raw snippet.
