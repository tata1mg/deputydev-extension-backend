        a new coding project. This tool does not execute any code; it only outputs instructions and metadata.

        The tool will return the status of the workspace creation:
        - If the workspace is created successfully, then proceed next steps.
        - First think(a lot first step-by-step) inside <thinking> tag about the initial project requirements , workspace structure and files, libraries needed for the project.
        - If the workspace requires additional libraries for setup or configuration, then use the `execute_command` tool.
        - Freely use other tools to complete the task.
