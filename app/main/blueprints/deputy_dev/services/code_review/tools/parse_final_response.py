        When the LLM has gathered all necessary code context and is ready to provide the final review comments,
        it should call this tool with the complete review in given format without missing any field. 
        including file paths, line numbers, messages, and confidence/severity attributes).
        Note: 
        - For each finding or improvement, create a separate comment object within the comments.
        - If you find nothing to improve the PR, there should be no comment inside comments key and just return an empty array. Don't say anything other than identified issues/improvements. If no issue is identified, don't say anything.
        
        This tool should only be called when the LLM has finished gathering all the necessary information and is ready to provide the final review.
        Always Provide response for this Tool in Tool Use Request block.
