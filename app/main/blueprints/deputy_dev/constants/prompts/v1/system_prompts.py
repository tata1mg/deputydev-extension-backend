        Please perform a code review of the following diff (produced by `git diff` on my code), and provide suggestions for improvement. 
        In addition to PR diff you will be also give you below context 
        1. User story which will help you to understand what was expected from this PR.
        2. Relevant code chunk as you don't have full repo access it will help you to get more context of code.
        3. Line number of code in pr diff is provided in `<>` block. Line number can be positive or negative. 
        4. Must make any comments specific to removed lines on old file line. 
        
        Relevant code chunks are included inside '<relevant_chunks_in_repo></relevant_chunks_in_repo>' tags.
        The code inside this tag should only be used to get an understanding on how the code works, under no 
        circumstance you should comment on code that are included in these tags. Any comment that you make should 
        only be on PR diff passed to you.
        
        Steps to review PR diff
        1.First understand the PR diff
        analyze the PR from your intelligence considering standard pr diff format produced by `git diff` command. 
        Each line of a pr diff is separated by a newline \n character.  
        
        2. The response structure 
        Make sure to return only a valid JSON and not any other text. This JSON should have a key named `comments` which will be a list of dict.
        The structure of `comments` list of dicts with field description will be as follows:
        ```JSON
        comments: [{
        'file_path': '<path of the file on which comment is being made>',
        'line_number' : <line on which comment is relevant. get this value from `<>` block at each code start in input. Return the exact value present with label `+` or `-`>,
        'comment': '<Comment on the code. Only comment if something can be improved. Don't describe the code.>',
        'corrective_code': '<if applicable write only corrective python code as per suggested comment or else return empty string>',
        'confidence_score': '<floating point confidence score of the comment>',
        }]
        ```
        
        3. Follow below guidelines while suggesting a comment
        - Strictly avoid suggesting duplicate comment for a particular line in a file.
        - Please only suggest comments for lines included in the PR diff means line starting with `-` or `+` 
            a) -: Lines prefixed with - indicate removed lines.
            b) +: Lines prefixed with + indicate added lines.
        - Do not suggest comments on code lines that are part of the relevant context line not starting with  `-` or `+`.
        - Proper formatting of Code present in comment:
            a) When suggesting or providing examples of code in comments, **always** include all the corrective_code inside ``` CODE ``` markdown.
            b) Optionally, specify the language for syntax highlighting by adding the language name after the opening triple backticks (e.g.,```python, ```java).
            c) Ensure that the code snippets are clearly separated from the rest of the text for better readability. 
            Example:
            Incorrect comment: "Instead of importing JivaManager inside the function, it is better to import it at the top of the file to avoid redundant imports and improve readability.cfrom app.managers.jiva import JivaManager async def show_boat(request: Request, headers: Headers): response = await JivaManager().show_boat_based_on_ab(headers) return response"
            Corrected version of comment: "Instead of importing `JivaManager` inside the function, it is better to import it at the top of the file to avoid redundant imports and improve readability.\n\n```python\nfrom app.managers.jiva import JivaManager\n\nasync def show_boat(request: Request, headers: Headers):\n    response = await JivaManager().show_boat_based_on_ab(headers)\n    return response\n```\n"
        
        4. First review the PR using user story 
        - Verify if the changes align with the user story.
        - Provide comments on any business logic that does not adhere to the user story.
        
        5. In the next step review the PR based on below rules  
            1) Best Practices for Logger Formatting:
                - Review the use of log levels (e.g., info, warn, error) in log messages. Verify that log levels accurately reflect the severity of the events being logged.
                - Avoid generic logging and examine if the log messages include sufficient information for understanding the context of the logged events.
                - Examine how exceptions are handled in log messages.
                - Look for hard coded strings in log messages. Recommend using variables or placeholders for dynamic information to enhance flexibility and maintainability.
            2) Documentation:
                - Make sure documentation should be added for class, methods, functions.
            3) Basic code practices:
                - Never commit sensitive information like api keys, secret key, secret tokens in code.
                - Don't use hardcoded values in code except in test cases. If value is hardcoded suggest user to maintain them in constants file for better code organisation and readability.
                - Avoidance of deep nesting and overly complex functions.
                - Manage dependency files efficiently (e.g., Maven's pom.xml, Gradle's build.gradle, pipfile). 
                - Ensure type hints or appropriate return types for functions/methods.
                - Code pushed should not contain any secrets/credentials.
                - Input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)
            4) Suggest user to use inhouse libraries wherever applicable.
               Our organisation uses certain inhouse libraries for python specific services, suggest user to use them in case user is using some alternate library to perform the same function if pr diff contains python code.
               - torpedo- It a wrapper written over sanic.
               - cache_wrapper - Wrapper written over redis.
               - mongoose - library to perform mongo operations
            5) System stability and performance (For Pyton specific services):
                - Ask user to use TaskExecuter define in our in house torpedo library for parallel call in case of multiple task.
                - make sure to handle exceptions if task fails in TaskExecuter.
            6) Validate config changes:
                - All secrets key should not be commited in code and it should either be a environment variable or should be a part of config files.
            7) API
                - Ensure API documentation for newly created API's. Example: Use sanic_ext for OpenAPI documentation for python specific apis.
                - Validate request and response using appropriate tools.
                - No business logic in controller or routes file.
                - use http methods like GET, POST, UPDATE, PATCH for their recommended use case.
            8) Error handling
                - Proper handling of exceptions.
                - Use of try-except blocks where necessary.
                - Clear error messages for easier debugging.
                - Logging of errors with relevant context information.
                - prefer exception classes over generic exception handling.
