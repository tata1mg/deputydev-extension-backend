SCRIT_PROMPT = """
        Please perform a code review of the following diff (produced by `git diff` on my code), and provide suggestions for improvement. 
        In addition to PR diff you will be also give you below context 
        1. User story which will help you to understand what was expected from this PR.
        2. Relevant code chunk as you don't have full repo access it will help you to get more context of code.
        3. Line number of code in pr diff is provided in `<>` block. Line number can be positive or negative. 
        4. Must make any comments specific to removed lines on old file line. 

        Relevant code chunks are included inside '<relevant_chunks_in_repo></relevant_chunks_in_repo>' tags.
        The code inside this tag should only be used to get an understanding on how the code works, under no 
        circumstance you should comment on code that are included in these tags. Any comment that you make should 
        only be on PR diff passed to you.

        Steps to review PR diff
        1.First understand the PR diff
        analyze the PR from your intelligence considering standard pr diff format produced by `git diff` command. 
        Each line of a pr diff is separated by a newline \n character.  

        2. The response structure 
        Make sure to return only a valid JSON and not any other text. This JSON should have a key named `comments` which will be a list of dict.
        The structure of `comments` list of dicts with field description will be as follows:
        ```JSON
        comments: [{
        'file_path': '<path of the file on which comment is being made>',
        'line_number' : <line on which comment is relevant. get this value from `<>` block at each code start in input. Return the exact value present with label `+` or `-`>,
        'comment': '<Comment on the code. Only comment if something can be improved. Don't describe the code.>',
        'corrective_code': '<if applicable write only corrective python code as per suggested comment or else return empty string>',
        'confidence_score': '<floating point confidence score of the comment>',
        'bucket_name': '<bucket name of the comment>'
        }]
        ```

        3. Follow below guidelines while suggesting a comment
        - Strictly avoid suggesting duplicate comment for a particular line in a file.
        - Please only suggest comments for lines included in the PR diff means line starting with `-` or `+` 
            a) -: Lines prefixed with - indicate removed lines.
            b) +: Lines prefixed with + indicate added lines.
        - Do not suggest comments on code lines that are part of the relevant context line not starting with  `-` or `+`.
        - Proper formatting of Code present in comment:
            a) When suggesting or providing examples of code in comments, **always** include all the corrective_code inside ``` CODE ``` markdown.
            b) Optionally, specify the language for syntax highlighting by adding the language name after the opening triple backticks (e.g.,```python, ```java).
            c) Ensure that the code snippets are clearly separated from the rest of the text for better readability. 
            Example:
            Incorrect comment: "Instead of importing JivaManager inside the function, it is better to import it at the top of the file to avoid redundant imports and improve readability.cfrom app.managers.jiva import JivaManager async def show_boat(request: Request, headers: Headers): response = await JivaManager().show_boat_based_on_ab(headers) return response"
            Corrected version of comment: "Instead of importing `JivaManager` inside the function, it is better to import it at the top of the file to avoid redundant imports and improve readability.\n\n```python\nfrom app.managers.jiva import JivaManager\n\nasync def show_boat(request: Request, headers: Headers):\n    response = await JivaManager().show_boat_based_on_ab(headers)\n    return response\n```\n"

        4. First review the PR using user story 
        - Verify if the changes align with the user story.
        - Provide comments on any business logic that does not adhere to the user story.
            
        5. In the next step must review the PR based on below rules. 
        About rules:
            1. Each rules(L1) defines sub rules(L2) for which we have to make comments.
            2. The comment should be bucketed. bucket names are title of L1 rule. 
            example: for first rule bucket name is CODE_QUALITY  
            3. Don't return L2 level bucket name only L1 level bucket name should be returned.
       
        Rules:
