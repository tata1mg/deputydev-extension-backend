\section{Additional features}

\subsection{Context-aware chatting}
Authors or reviewers of PRs can also chat with DeputyDev by initializing with \#dd or \#deputydev and then their prompt. This is a powerful feature which can not only answer any technical questions while being completely context-aware but can also generate code, tests and documentations or just act as a learning companion for developers.

Some examples are as follows-
\begin{itemize}
    \item \#dd - Why are parameterized queries safer?
    \item \#dd - Generate a docstring for this function.
\end{itemize}

Refer to Appendix \ref{app:capabilities} for screenshots of above examples

\subsection{PR summary}
DeputyDev also generates impeccable PR summaries along with its size w.r.t. LOCs changed in the PR and estimated time to review the PR. This is particularly helpful for reviewers and service owners to get a gist of the change being made quickly at a glance without actually going through the diff.
