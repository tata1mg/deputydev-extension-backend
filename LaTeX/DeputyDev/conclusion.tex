\section{Conclusion}
This study has identified and addressed significant inefficiencies in the conventional code review process widely adopted across the software industry. These inefficiencies not only result in considerable time losses but also contribute to developer frustration. To mitigate these issues, we have introduced DeputyDev, an innovative automated tool for contextual code reviews triggered by pull request submissions. We have detailed the implementation of DeputyDev, highlighting its use of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and semantic search to generate optimized context. Furthermore, we have demonstrated DeputyDev's seamless integration with Atlassian suite products such as Jira and Confluence, enabling validation of code changes against business requirements.

To evaluate the effectiveness of DeputyDev, we conducted a rigorous double-controlled A/B experiment. The results revealed a substantial reduction in the time required for pull request reviews when utilizing DeputyDev. These findings underscore the significant value that DeputyDev can offer to various stakeholders in the development lifecycle, including developers and reviewers. Our research thus presents DeputyDev as a promising solution to enhance efficiency and satisfaction in the code review process, potentially transforming current industry practices.
