\section{Choice of model}
DeputyDev currently integrates with OpenAI and Anthropic. We use OpenAI's GPT-4o for PR summarization because of its superior summarization capabilities and Anthropic's claude 3.5 sonnet to perform actual code reviews due to its superior performance on HumanEval benchmark \cite{anthropic}

Both models are highly capable and best in the industry right now. DeputyDev does not use any fine-tuned model as of now.
